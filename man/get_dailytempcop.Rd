get_dailytempcop(
  use_cache = TRUE,
  write_cache = getOption("hs_write_cache"),
  region = "W"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{use_cache}{(boolean) Return cached data if available, defaults to TRUE. Use FALSE to fetch updated data.}

\item{write_cache}{(boolean) Write data to cache, defaults to FALSE. Use TRUE to write data to cache for later use. Can also be set using options(hs_write_cache=TRUE)}

\item{region}{(string) Region selection, defaults to world air temperature. Options are: World Air "W".}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a tibble with the daily 2-meter air temperatures since 1940 as well as historic mean by day-of-year and current anomaly versus mean.

\code{get_dailytempcop} invisibly returns a tibble with the daily temperatures since 1940 as well as mean by day-of-year and anomaly.

Region options include world air (default).
The historic daily mean-by-day period defaults to 1991-2020.

Data are updated daily.

Notes: daily mean surface air temperature (2-meter height) estimates from the ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) for the period January 1940 to present. ERA5 is a state-of-the-art numerical climate/weather modeling framework that ingests surface, radiosonde, and satellite observations to estimate the state of the atmosphere through time.
ERA5 files have a horizontal grid resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° (about 31km x 31km at 45°N). Each daily temperature represents an average across all model gridcells within the defined latitude/longitude bounds for the selected domain. The means are area-weighted to account for the convergence of longitude lines at the poles
