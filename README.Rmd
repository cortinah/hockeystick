The goal of `hockeystick` is to make essential Climate Change datasets easily available to non-climate experts. `hockeystick` users can download the latest raw data from authoritative sources as well as view it via pre-defined ggplot2 charts. Datasets include atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, instrumental and ice-core temperature records, sea levels, and Arctic/Antarctic sea-ice. Additional visualizations using this data will be added over time.

The choice of data is based on [Professor Stefan Rahmstorf's ](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/) presentation on [The 5 Most Important Data Sets of Climate Science](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/5datasets_rahmstorf.pdf). I came across this on a post on the [Open Mind blog](https://tamino.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/the-5-most-important-data-sets-of-climate-science/). I wrote my own [post](http://rethinking.rbind.io/2018/11/16/the-top-five-climate-charts-using-ggplot2/) on obtaining and visualizing this data (now out of date), which is the basis for this package.

## Installation

You may install the development version of `hockeystick` from [https://github.com/cortinah/hockeystick](https://github.com/cortinah/hockeystick) with:
  
  ``` r
remotes::install_github("cortinah/hockeystick")
```

## Downloading and viewing climate change data

Retrieve NOAA/ESRL Mauna Loa CO<sub>2</sub> Observatory concentration data and plot it:

```{r carbon, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
library(hockeystick)
ml_co2 <- get_carbon()
plot_carbon(ml_co2)
```

Retrieve NASA/GISS global surface temperature anomaly data and plot it:

```{r temp, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
anomaly <- get_temp()
plot_temp(anomaly)
```

Visualize warming using Ed Hawkins styled "warming stripes":
```{r stripes, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
warming_stripes()
```
```{r stripes2, out.width='53%', fig.retina=2}
warming_stripes(stripe_only = TRUE, col_strip = viridisLite::viridis(11))
```

Retrieve tide gauge and satellite sea level data and plot it:

```{r sl, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
gmsl <- get_sealevel()
plot_sealevel(gmsl)
```

Retrieve July annual Arctic Sea Ice Index and plot it:

```{r si, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
seaice <- get_seaice()
plot_seaice(seaice)
```

`get_seaice()` arguments can be modified to download Antarctic sea ice, and allow any month.

You can also visualize Sea Ice by month and year:

```{r icecurves, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
arcticice <- get_icecurves()
plot_icecurves(arcticice)
```

Retrieve Vostok ice core data and plot it:

```{r paleo, out.width='64%', fig.retina=2}
vostok <- get_paleo()
plot_paleo(vostok)
```

### Managing the cache
Data is cached for future use the first time it is downloaded using any of the `get_` functions. To view the files, date, and size of cached info use `hockeystick_cache_details()`.  To re-download or update data from the source use the `use_cache = FALSE` argument in any of the `get_` functions, for example: `get_carbon(use_cache = FALSE)`.  To delete all cached data use `hockeystick_cache_delete_all()`.

### All together now: Climate Data Grid
```{r grid, out.width='80%', fig.retina=2}
climate_grid()
```

## Notes and Resources
- While all data is compiled from reliable sources, I am not a climate scientist. I am building `hockeystick` because of my interest in tracking climate data and making it easily available to the community.
- Here are some online resources I have found very helpful to learn more about climate science:
- MIT edX Global Warming Science. https://www.edx.org/course/global-warming-science
- SDG Academy: Climate Change: The Science and Global Impact. https://sdgacademy.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact/
