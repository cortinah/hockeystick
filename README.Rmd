The goal of `hockeystick` is to make essential Global Heating datasets easily available in R to non-climate experts. `hockeystick` users can download the latest raw data from authoritative sources as well as view it via pre-defined ggplot2 charts. Datasets include atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, carbon emissions, instrumental, reconstructed, and paleo ice-core temperature records, sea levels, hurricanes, and Arctic/Antarctic sea-ice.

The choice of data was originally based on [Professor Stefan Rahmstorf's ](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/) presentation on [The 5 Most Important Data Sets of Climate Science](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/5datasets_rahmstorf.pdf). I came across this on a post on the [Open Mind blog](https://tamino.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/the-5-most-important-data-sets-of-climate-science/). I wrote my own [post](https://rethinking.rbind.io/2018/11/16/the-top-five-climate-charts-using-ggplot2/) on obtaining and visualizing this data (now out of date), which is the basis for this package. Additional datasets and visualizations have been added over  The name of the package stems from the well known [hockeystick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_graph) temperature chart. 

`hockeystick` was highlighted on the RStudio [RViews](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/03/19/february-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/) blog by Joseph Rickert as one of the "Top 40" new packages on CRAN in February 2021.

**New in version 0.8.0:** Daily temperature data from ClimateReanalyzer.com (see below).

New in version 0.7.0: Globally averaged methane (CH~4~) concentration from NOAA.

New in version 0.7.0: Cumulative emissions by country visualization.

New in version 0.6.0: Global CO~2~ emissions by region and country from GCP.

## Installation
To install the latest `hockeystick` release from CRAN type:

``` r
install.packages("hockeystick")
```


You may alternatively install the development version from [https://github.com/cortinah/hockeystick](https://github.com/cortinah/hockeystick) with:
  
``` r
remotes::install_github("cortinah/hockeystick")
```

## Downloading and viewing global heating data

New: Plot daily global temperatures since 1940 and current anomaly:

```{r dailytemp, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.asp=1.03}
library(hockeystick)
globaldaily <- get_dailytemp()
plot_dailytemp(globaldaily)
```

Retrieve NOAA/ESRL Mauna Loa CO<sub>2</sub> Observatory concentration data and plot:

```{r carbon, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
ml_co2 <- get_carbon()
plot_carbon(ml_co2)
```

Retrieve GCP global CO~2~ emissions and plot:

```{r emissions, out.width='65%', fig.retina=2, message=FALSE}
emissions <- get_emissions()
plot_emissions(emissions)
plot_emissions_with_land(emissions)
```

Visualize cumulative emissions by country:
```{r emissionsmap, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
emissions_map()
```

Retrieve NASA/GISS global surface temperature anomaly data and plot:

```{r temp, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
anomaly <- get_temp()
plot_temp(anomaly)
```

Plot relationship between temperature anomaly and carbon:
```{r tempcarbon, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
plot_carbontemp()
```

Visualize warming using Ed Hawkins styled "warming stripes":
```{r stripes, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
warming_stripes()
```
```{r stripes2, out.width='53%', fig.retina=2}
warming_stripes(stripe_only = TRUE, col_strip = viridisLite::viridis(11))
```

Retrieve tide gauge and satellite sea level data and plot:

```{r sl, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
gmsl <- get_sealevel()
plot_sealevel(gmsl)
```

Retrieve July annual Arctic Sea Ice Index and plot:

```{r si, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%', warning=FALSE}
seaice <- get_seaice()
plot_seaice(seaice)
```

`get_seaice()` arguments can be modified to download Antarctic sea ice, and allow any month.

You can also visualize sea ice by month and year:

```{r icecurves, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
arcticice <- get_icecurves()
plot_icecurves(arcticice)
```

Retrieve Common Era temperature reconstruction and plot it with instrumental record:

```{r 2ktemp, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2}
anomaly2k <- get_temp2k()
plot_temp2k(anomaly2k)
```

Retrieve NOAA HURDAT2 hurricane data and plot:

```{r hurricanes, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2, message=FALSE}
hurricanes <- get_hurricanes()
plot_hurricanes(hurricanes)
plot_hurricane_nrg(hurricanes)
```

Retrieve NOAA/ESRL CH<sub>4</sub> Globally averaged mean data and plot:

```{r methane, fig.retina=2, message=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
ch4 <- get_methane()
plot_methane(ch4)
```

Retrieve Vostok paleo ice core data and plot:

```{r paleo, out.width='60%', fig.retina=2, message=FALSE}
vostok <- get_paleo()
plot_paleo(vostok)
```

### Managing the cache
By default, no climate data is cached, and all data is downloaded every time any of the `get_` functions is called. To cache data for future use, use the `write_cache = TRUE` option, available in all of the `get_` functions. To download and cache all data use `hockeystick_update_all()`. To view the files, date, and size of cached data use `hockeystick_cache_details()`.  To re-download data from the source use the `use_cache = FALSE` argument in any of the `get_` functions, for example: `get_carbon(use_cache = FALSE, write_cache = TRUE)`.  To delete all cached data use `hockeystick_cache_delete_all()`.

Users may also cache data by default by adding `options(hs_write_cache = TRUE)`to their script or `.Rprofile` file.

### All together now: climate data grid
```{r grid, out.width='80%', fig.retina=2, warning=FALSE}
climate_grid()
```

## Notes and resources
- All data is compiled to the best of my ability from reliable and peer-reviewed sources. Please open an issue if you are aware of enhanced or additional data that may be added to the package. Building `hockeystick` is driven by my interest in tracking climate data and making it easily available to the community.
- Here are some online resources I have found very helpful to learn mo    re about climate science:
- MIT edX Global Warming Science. https://www.edx.org/learn/global-warming/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-global-warming-science
- SDG Academy: Climate Change: The Science and Global Impact. https://sdgacademy.org/course/climate-change-the-science-and-global-impact/
